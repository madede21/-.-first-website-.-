    <p><b>Halloween</b> traces its origins to the ancient <i>Celtic</i> festival of <b>Samhain</b>, celebrated over 2,000 years ago in what is now Ireland, Scotland, and parts of France. The Celts marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter, believing that on the night of October 31st, the boundary between the living and the dead was thinnest. To protect themselves from wandering spirits, people would light bonfires and wear costumes, often made from animal heads and skins, to ward off ghosts.</p>

    <p>Over time, Halloween evolved with influences from <i>Roman</i> and <i>Christain</i> traditions. By the 8th century, <b>Pope Gregory III</b> designated November 1st as All Saints' Day, and the night before became known as All Hallows' Eve, eventually shortened to Halloween. As European immigrants, particularly the Irish, brought their customs to America in the 19th century, Halloween became a more community-centered celebration, eventually transforming into the candy-filled holiday we know today.</p>
